# Wedge

Causes upstream nodes to be dispatched multiple times in a range
of contexts, each time with a different value for a specified variable.
This variable should be referenced in upstream expressions to apply
variation to the tasks being performed. For instance, it could be
used to drive a shader parameter to perform a series of "wedges" to
demonstrate the results of a range of possible parameter values.
