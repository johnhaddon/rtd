# Box

A container for "subgraphs" - node networks which exist inside the
Box and can be exposed by promoting selected internal plugs onto the
outside of the Box.

Boxes can be used as an organisational tool for simplifying large
graphs by collapsing them into sections which perform distinct tasks.
They are also used for authoring files to be used with the Reference
node.
