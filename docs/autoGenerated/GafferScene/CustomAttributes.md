# CustomAttributes

Applies arbitrary user-defined attributes to locations in the scene. Note
that for most common cases the StandardAttributes, OpenGLAttributes, RenderManAttributes,
and ArnoldAttributes nodes should be used in preference - they provide predefined
sets of attributes with customised user interfaces. The CustomAttributes node is of most use when
needing to set a custom attribute not supported by the specialised nodes.
