# MeshType

Changes between polygon and subdivision representations
for mesh objects, and optionally recalculates vertex
normals for polygon meshes.

Note that currently the Gaffer viewport does not display
subdivision meshes with smoothing, so the results of using
this node will not be seen until a render is performed.
